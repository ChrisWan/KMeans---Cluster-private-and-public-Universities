# KMeans---Cluster-private-and-public-Universities
In this guided project, I tried to distinguish public and private universities based on their other features. After that I compared the results of the clustering with the ground truth and KMean did a very good job here. To note is that usually there are no labels available when using unsupervised techniques but here I had them.
